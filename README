Need:
Change Edit user and new user functionality to be rendered in admin page only
use included js for autocompletion?

Todo:
-
- change admissions layout so that title includes patient's name
- work out search/dynamic results - jquery?
- Change input of new admission so that Departure date is set to Admission date once admission date is entered.

Failures:

Low priority:
Make UK datetime display format as per api documentation (dd/mm/YYYY).

Wishlist:

Low priority:
Construct a route that looks like this:
# map.admit 'patients/:patient_id/admit', :controller => 'admissions', :action => 'admit'

In the distance:

Done:
 Add link in patients/show to add new admission for that patient_id
